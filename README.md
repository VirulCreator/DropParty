# DropParty
Drop Party is a simple, easy to use plugin that lets you create drop parties on your server.

## Overview
GKits are unique kits, which are mostly focused on improving donators gameplay. They usually are well-liked when using Custom Enchantment plugins and giving the GKits rare enchantments.
